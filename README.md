# wrapThem
Tried to write few wrapping scripts for some of the important tools

I also includes som small but useful scripts. If you can understand and use them by your own, Hurray, otherwise feel free
to ask me.

Most of them are hard coded, therefore you will have to make some efforts in order to use them.
